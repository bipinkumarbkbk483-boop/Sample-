## **Introduction**
AI Python for Beginners is designed to help you leverage the power of Python programming, even if your goal isn’t to become a software developer or AI engineer. This four-part course teaches you to code practical AI applications from day one, whether you’re an experienced programmer, or writing “Hello, World!” for the first time. You’ll learn with support from an AI chatbot that can provide you with immediate feedback, answer your questions, quickly identify and work through bugs, and keep you on track while learning new skills. 

## **2. Point to be noted**
By the end of this course series, you’ll be able to write Python scripts that interact with large language models, automate tasks, and analyze your own data. You’ll even learn how to extend Python’s capabilities using popular third-party packages for data analysis and visualization, and how to access real-time information through APIs. These are skills that are increasingly valuable across industries from tech and finance to healthcare and creative fields.

## **3. Hands-on projects**
Throughout this course, you’ll engage in practical, hands-on exercises that reinforce your learning and demonstrate the wide range of possibilities for what you can create with Python and AI. Here are some of the projects you’ll work on:

Custom Recipe Generator: Create an AI-powered tool that generates unique recipes based on available ingredients. You’ll use variables, f-strings, and AI prompts to craft personalized culinary creations.
Smart To-Do List: Build an intelligent task manager that not only stores your to-do items but also prioritizes them using AI. You’ll apply your knowledge of lists, dictionaries, and decision-making code to enhance productivity.
Travel Blog Analyzer: Develop a program that reads travel blog entries and uses AI to extract key information like restaurant names and popular dishes. This exercise showcases your ability to work with files and leverage AI for text analysis.
